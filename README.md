# Simple GUI Introduction
We are going to use PySimpleGUI to create a user interface for our python applications. To do this, we will need to download the PySimpleGUI module. 

## Instructions
Download the source code into you projects folder.
You must install the requirements.

Open the projects folder in Visual Studio Code (or whichever IDE you are using)
In the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the py files. 

Type the following in the command line:
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you read the code first. Try to understand what it should do before running it. To run:
        $ python 1simplest.py

Do the same for each of the files, and then try the problems below:


## TO DO
A. Create a GUI application that says "What do you watch on TV?" when it loads. Make it have a button that says "Netflix", and when I push the Netflix button, the "What do you watch on TV?" text is replaced with the word NETFLIX

B. Add a "Stan" and "Twitch" button to the app you just made, which do the same thing as the "Netflix" button (except these replace the text with "Stan" and "twitch" respectively)

C. Add an "Exit" button, a "Clear" button and a "Reset" button to the program you just made. Put all the TV buttons on one row, and the "Exit," "Clear" and "Reset" buttons on a different row underneath. Make the "Exit" button break out of the main loop when I click it. Make the "Clear" button clear all text that is showing in the "What do you watch on TV?" text element. Make the "Reset" button show the original text when the app loads ("What do you watch on TV?").
